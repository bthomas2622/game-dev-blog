          <p>I wanted to get some thoughts and rambles down during these tough and important times.</p>
          <p>I want to write a little bit about non-games stuff before we get to the games stuff. Diversity is important. Being anti-racist is important. Black and brown people being murdered in the streets and systematically oppressed at every level of society needs to fucking end. I’m not an expert in this stuff. I’m not a writer. I’m not a researcher. I am a privileged white straight cisgender man that has benefited from the corrupt bargain my whole life. But I’m doing my best to stay informed and be an activist and be a part of the forces that WILL slowly right our society.</p>
          <p>Turning towards games… Something I have done my whole life. Games have been my refuge and my passion for as long as I can remember. Games are special to me for so many reasons including:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Games allow me to inhabit stories, worlds, and perspectives that I could never dream of in my normal life.</li>
            <li>Games teach me how to solve problems creatively by immersing me in new and exciting situations.</li>
            <li>Games move me with art about the human experience.</li>
            <li>Games provide me a worldwide community of enthusiastic gamers and game developers who all push each other to have fun and grow together.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The list goes on. But for each of the points above I am struck by how diversity is so core to games being special. And that diversity is the core to the path forward where games grow and evolve. There are so many rad games out there but on today,June 14, 2020, I can’t help but feel games are letting us down and need to rapidly become more inclusive in order to break barriers.</p>
          <p>So many games are made and marketed to the lowest common denominator of me. Young white straight cisgender dude who grew up playing and loving Halo. And I gotta say it’s fucking boring. It feels like every dang game across every dang genre uses violence as the driver behind it’s core game mechanic. Throw in a sarcastic gruff dude or fierce mysterious sexy woman. I play genres spanning FPS, action, strategy, deck building, narrative, etc. Lot’s of guns, slashing, and death. I love apex legends and slay the spire and darkest dungeon so dang much but what if there was more? Where is the romance? Where is the dark comedy? Where are the first kisses or surfing with turtles or whatever?</p>
          <p>I’m not trying to say games aren’t good right now. Or there aren’t tons of games that subvert genre tropes and are the opposite of what I’m rambling about. I just feel like games could be in a different place. And when I try to see how they could get to a place that’s more exciting for me the thing staring me in the face is the overwhelming male whiteness of the industry. The homogeneity of perspective. I want this not just selfishly so I can play more cool games, but because it is wrong to exclude. It feels so gross. We are making progress no doubt, but let’s make progress faster because everyone deserves to partake and frolic and profit from this magical medium.</p>
